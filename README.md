This repository contains the materials for the second day of the DATPREP course. Solutions and more information for this day can be found [here](http://www.ux.uis.no/~trygve-e/pythonintro.html). All the files used in this course are included in this repository.

## Setting up the coding environment 
We recommend you to install anaconda and work on Jupyter notebook. If you are familiar with python programming, you can choose whatever tool that you want to use.
